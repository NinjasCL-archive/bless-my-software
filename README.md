to protect or guard from evil:

## Why Blessing Our Software?

Many software projects both closed and libre/open source ones are being used for causing harm and supporting *"evil"* activities. And unless you have economic and legal resources available for enforcing more ethical uses of your work you can´t really do much to stop that.

A blessing with best wishes and *"evil protection"* it the least we can do for spreading the message. A message that says to anyone using our work that we care about creating a better world. Hopping that the projects they will make using our software will have a positive impact in the planet and lives of current and future generations.

## How to Bless?

Simple, just create a text file named [*"BLESSING"*](https://github.com/blessmy/software/blob/master/BLESSING.md) and fill it with your blessing. It can be anything you want, some thoughts, a quote, a poem. The only thing that matters is that represent your vision of a better world and best whishes to anyone using your work.

### Is this a New Software License?

**No**. Is just a file named *"Blessing"* with a nice message :). You can use any software license you already know and love.

### Badge
Maybe you would like to include a badge in your *README*

![This software is Blessed](https://img.shields.io/badge/blessed-100%25-770493.svg)

```

```

### Examples

A good example is shown in the [SQLite license](https://www.sqlite.org/different.html#license)

>  The SQLite source code contains no license since it is not governed by copyright. Instead of a license, the SQLite source code offers a blessing:
> 
> - May you do good and not evil
> - May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others
> - May you share freely, never taking more than you give. 

Another example is the [Hanafuda Captain](http://www.siliconera.com/2017/01/08/hidden-message-contained-nintendo-classic-mini-famicom/) message in the Nes Mini.

> "This is the hanafuda captain speaking. Launching emulation in 3...2...1. Many efforts, tears and countless hours have been put into this jewel. So, please keep this place tidied up and don't break everything! Cheers, the hanafuda captain."

Nintendo engineers were aware that people would mess around with the Nes Mini. So they put a nice message for the potential hackers out there.

## How this did come about?

I saw the [No Harm License](https://github.com/raisely/NoHarm/issues/35) and commented about regarding enforceability. I think that project is a good start if you are an organization that could enforce such higher ethical values to customers, partners and users by using contracts, terms of use and terms of service. In my opinion, if you are a small team or a single developer releasing software without contracts of any kind, then using already available software licenses plus blessing is a nice aproach to bring the message of a better world.

## Why do this at all?

Because we are humans. In the same fashion as [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/). We are people not robots. We have emotions and want to make a dent in the world. A little blessing with a positive message is just another way to contribute to humanity's continuos improvement.
